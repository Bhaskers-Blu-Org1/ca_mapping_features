# ca_mapping_features

This repository provides information about supported recognised geographic features in maps in IBM Cognos Analytics releases.

Locate the folder matching the release you are on or the next previous version if there's no exact match : features are not guaranteed to update on a per-release basis.

In each folder you will find:
* A file called "**IBM CA 11.1 Administrative Hierarchy.xlsx**" which provides a summary of each supported country with the type and count of supported subregions.
* A file called "**IBM CA 11.1 Administrative Features.xlsx**" which provides an exhaustive list of each feature name with all the recognised aliases for that feature
